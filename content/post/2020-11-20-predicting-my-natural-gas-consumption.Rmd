It's been a while since I posted on this blog. That was mainly due to the confinement
in the covid-19 pandemic. And it's a promise the last time I mention this virus.

Let's get away from all that and look at energy consumption and global warming instead.
That will lift our spirits!

Here I the packages I need to attach.


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("tsibble") 
library("lubridate")
library("zoo")
library("rvest")
library("glue")
library("reactable") 
library("scales")
library("hrbrthemes")
library("stationaRy")
```

I've been recording the gas meter index for almost ten years now. 

This is our prime data source:

<center>
![meter](/img/20201120/meter.jpg)

<\center>


The data point are from around the end of each month. So this data can be loaded from the xl file.



```{r, fig.align='center'}
gas <- readxl::read_excel("./data/20201120/gas.xlsx")
head(gas) %>% 
  reactable(columns = list(
    date = colDef(format = colFormat(date = TRUE)),
    gas_meter = colDef(format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, locales = "en-EN"))
  ), compact = TRUE, width = 250)
```
Next we will build a time series with an entry for every day. By firstly creating an index, using the tsibble (package)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsibble/index.html].

```{r}

n_days <- as.integer(max(gas$date) - min(gas$date))
days <- ymd(min(gas$date)) + days(0:n_days)
ts_gas <- tsibble(days = days, index = days) %>% 
  rename("date" = "days")
ts_gas %>% head(5)

```

Next join our meter data to the index. It logically results in mostly missing values per date.


```{r}
ts_gas <-ts_gas %>% 
  left_join(gas %>% 
              mutate(date = ymd(date)))
ts_gas %>% head(5)
```

But we can use the zoo package to fill in the NAs with a linear interpolation between values like so:

```{r}
ts_gas$gas_meter <-  na.approx(ts_gas$gas_meter)

head(ts_gas)

```

This gives a smooth time-series that can be plotted like this:

```{r}
ggplot(data = ts_gas, aes(x=  date, y = gas_meter))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x="year", y="gas meter")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
But this is just the evolution of the gas meter. The gas consumption is more interesting. The dplyr, lead function will help us here:

```{r}
ts_gas <- ts_gas %>% 
   mutate(cons = lead(x = gas_meter, 1, default = NA) - gas_meter )

```

An plotting it we get:

```{r warning=False}
ggplot(data = ts_gas, aes(x=  date, y = cons))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that the gas consumption forms little plateaus per month, that is of course because we did a linear extrapolation. The chart gives us a clear seasonal pattern. And maybe a downward trend, but we will look at this a bit further down. 

Plotting the average consumption per months over the years:

```{r, warning=False, message=False}
ts_gas_month <- ts_gas %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.factor(month(date))) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year(date))) %>% 
  filter(year!=2010 & year!=2021) %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarise(cons = mean(cons))

ggplot(data = ts_gas_month, aes(x=  month, y = cons, group = year))+
  geom_line(aes(color = year))+
  theme_minimal()

```

No surprise since we need to heat during the winter months. I used to take holidays in July or August so this is where the minima are situated, since no gas is then used for a couple of weeks. 

The same data can be used to plot a heat map:

```{r}
ggplot(data = ts_gas_month , aes(year, month, fill= cons)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="red")

```

The package stationRy enables getting data from over 29 thousand weather stations including 52 Belgian weatherstations. Let's get data from the station in Uccle.


```{r}
#install.packages("stationaRy")

met_data <-get_station_metadata()

belgian_stations <- met_data %>% 
  filter(country == "BE")

be_met_data <-
  get_met_data(
    station_id = "064510-99999",
    years = 2010:2020
  )

```

That gives us 150k observations for the time period. One per hour 

```{r}
head(be_met_data)
```


And plotting the temperature data gives us something like this:

```{r}
ggplot(data = be_met_data, aes(x=  time, y = temp))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()
```

But it might be lighter to work with daily avarages.

```{r, warning==False}
be_met_data_day <- be_met_data %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(str_sub(time, 1, 10))) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(temp = mean(temp)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(temp)) %>% 
  mutate(month_ = as.factor(month(date))) %>% 
  mutate(year_ = as.factor(year(date))) %>% 
  filter(year_ != 2010 & year_ != 2021)
  

head(be_met_data_day)

```
And plotting the daily avarage gives us this plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = be_met_data_day, aes(x=  date, y = temp))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()
```
