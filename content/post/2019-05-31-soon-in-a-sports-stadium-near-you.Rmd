When I showed a colleague of mine the last [post](https://badtothecode.netlify.com/post/metallica-rules-the-world/), he suggested to construct an animated map with the geo location of the different Metallica concerts. By the way it turns out that the guy also sometimes enjoys being a metalhead. We both were right in front of the stage at Dessel on the 6th June 2015 for the last concert of AC/DC in Belgium, that is more than three years before we first met.

That is a coincidence. We could have found out if we had compared our Google location [history](https://badtothecode.netlify.com/post/google-location-tracking/). Hmm, an app could be made to do that. 

Anyway, back to a map & Metallica. Challenge accepted, Mr. Goodyear.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# libraries
library("gganimate") #install.packages("gganimate")
library("tidyverse")
library("glue")
library("directlabels")
```

The data from last post.

```{r}
concerts <- readRDS("./data/20190524/concerts.rds")
```

Plotting the Worldwired Tour.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
worldwired <- concerts %>% 
  filter(tour == "Worldwired Tour") %>% 
  mutate(country = ifelse(country == "Kong", "Hong Kong", country),
         country = ifelse(country == "Rica", "Costa Rica", country),
         country = ifelse(country == "Republic", "Czech Republic", country),
         country = paste("  ", country))

worlddata <- map_data('world') %>%
  filter(region != "Antarctica")

p <- ggplot() +
    geom_map(data = worlddata, map = worlddata,
                  aes(map_id=region),
                  fill = "white", colour = "gray85", size = 0.4) + 
    coord_map("rectangular", lat0=0, xlim=c(-180,180), ylim=c(-60, 90)) +
    geom_point(data = worldwired, aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             alpha = 0.9, color = "firebrick4", size = 2) +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_dl(data = worldwired, aes(x = lon, y = lat, label = country), 
            method= "last.points")

z <- p +
  transition_states(date,
                    transition_length = 1,
                    state_length = 2)+
  ggtitle("Worldwired tour: {current_frame} this must be:") +
  transition_manual(date) 

animate(z, fps =2, end_pause = 10)

```


Et voilÃ , an animated world map with the geo locations of Metallica's concert. Don't ask me to change the color of the little dots :smiling_imp:
