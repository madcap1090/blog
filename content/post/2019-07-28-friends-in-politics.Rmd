In the last post we tried hard to find out all the Twitter handles of our current parliamentarians. A number of interesting analyses can be done with the texts they tweet. But the legislature is quite young and since there still is no federal government and that we are in summer break there are not enough tweets to have interesting analyses at this moment.

One of the things we can analyse now are the links on Twitter between members of parliament as demonstrated by the excellent blog posts/code of Markus Konrad starting [here](https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2019/07/11/a-twitter-network-of-members-of-the-19th-german-bundestag-part-i/)

Let us see what can learn from using his analysis on the Belgian parliament. I am curious to find out. 

So gentle persons, attach you libraries. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library("rtweet")
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("igraph")
library("visNetwork")
```

Loading our reps data.

```{r}
reps_55 <- readRDS("~/R/blogs/content/post/data/20190716/reps_55.rds")
```

Getting their friends (you need to authenticate first).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
friends <- get_friends(reps_55$screen_name, retryonratelimit = TRUE)
```

So that leaves a pause of about 15 minutes per 10 Twitter handles analysed in order to stay within the rate limits. The data of the analysis. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
friends$fetch_friends_date <- Sys.Date() 
saveRDS(friends, "friends.rds")
```

So we have (on 2019-07-22) 103.840 friends of our reps. Now we can get the Twitter information of these one hundred thousand accounts, with some heavy mechanics from Markus. Hau ruck! 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
friends_ids <- unique(friends$user_id)
#friends_ids <- friends_ids[1:1000]   # subset for testing
n_friends_ids <- length(friends_ids)

# ---- look up information about each friend user ID ----

n_retries <- 5         
sleep_sec <- 16 * 60   
chunksize <- 100        
n_max_requests <- 280   
chunk_idx <- 0          
cur_retry <- 0          
friendsdata <- tibble() 0
print('fetching data from Twitter API...')
request_i <- 0   

while(TRUE) {
    chunk_start <- chunk_idx * chunksize + 1
    chunk_end <- min(c((chunk_idx + 1) * chunksize, n_friends_ids))
    friends_ids_chunk <- friends_ids[chunk_start:chunk_end]
    print(sprintf('fetching data for friends IDs in range [%d, %d] (%d ids)',
                  chunk_start, chunk_end, length(friends_ids_chunk)))
    success <- tryCatch({
        request_i <- request_i + 1
        friendsdata_chunk <- lookup_users(friends_ids_chunk)
        friendsdata <- bind_rows(friendsdata, friendsdata_chunk)
        TRUE
    }, error = function(cond) {
        FALSE
    })
    if (success) {  
        cur_retry <- 0   
        if (chunk_start + chunksize >= n_friends_ids) {
            break()
        }
    } else {  # on failure
        cur_retry <- cur_retry + 1
        if (cur_retry >= n_retries) {
            print(sprintf('failed after %d retries', cur_retry))
            break()
        }
        print(sprintf('will advance with retry %d', cur_retry))
    }
    if (request_i %% n_max_requests == 0 || !success) {    
        print(sprintf('waiting for %d sec.', sleep_sec))
        Sys.sleep(sleep_sec)
    }
    if (success) {   
        chunk_idx <- chunk_idx + 1
    }
}

n_fetched <- sum(!is.na(friendsdata$screen_name))
print(sprintf('got data for %d out of %d unique friends accounts', n_fetched, n_friends_ids))

friendsdata$fetch_friendsdata_timestamp <- Sys.time()   

# join friends user data by user ID
print('joining data...')
friendsfull <- left_join(friends, friendsdata, by = 'user_id')
n_matched <- sum(!is.na(friendsfull$screen_name))
print(sprintf('matching successful for %d out of %d rows', n_matched, nrow(friends)))

# save as RDS
saveRDS(friendsfull, './data/20190728/deputies_twitter_friends_full_20190722.RDS')
```

Treating the data that was collected. 

```{r}
deputies_twitter_friends_full_20190722 <- 
  readRDS("./data/20190728/deputies_twitter_friends_full_20190722.RDS")

friends_full <- deputies_twitter_friends_full_20190722

friends <- select(friends_full, user, fetch_friends_date,
                  fetch_friendsdata_timestamp,
                  created_at, screen_name, name,
                  location, description,
                  protected, followers_count, 
                  friends_count, statuses_count, 
                  account_created_at, verified,
                  account_lang) 
head(friends)
```

Some friends did not return a handle. 

```{r}
friends <- filter(friends, !is.na(screen_name))
```

Retain only the connections between deputies, not to other Twitter accounts

```{r}
dep_accounts <- unique(friends$user)   
dep_friends <- filter(friends, screen_name %in% dep_accounts) 
head(dep_friends)
```

Select twitter handles and parties

```{r}
dep_twitter_full <-  readRDS("~/R/blogs/content/post/data/20190716/reps_55.rds")

dep_twitter <- filter(dep_twitter_full, !is.na(screen_name))

dep_accounts_parties <- select(dep_twitter, screen_name, party)

```

Construct a data frame containing edges and nodes, of people but also of parties (through people). 

```{r}
edges_parties <- select(dep_friends, from_account = user, to_account = screen_name) %>%
    left_join(dep_accounts_parties, by = c('from_account' = 'screen_name')) %>%
    rename(from_party = party) %>%
    left_join(dep_accounts_parties, by = c('to_account' = 'screen_name')) %>%
    rename(to_party = party)

head(edges_parties)
```

Number of nodes:

```{r}
length(unique(edges_parties$from_account))
```

Number of edges:

```{r}
nrow(edges_parties)
```


Number of edges between parties:

```{r}
counts_p2p <- group_by(edges_parties, from_party, to_party) %>%
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(counts_p2p, 10)
```

Count the absolute number of edges per "from_party" (so the accounts followed, the 'friends', per party) this is required to calculate the proportions


```{r}
counts_party_edges <- group_by(counts_p2p, from_party) %>% 
  summarise(n_edges = sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_edges))
counts_party_edges
```

add a column "prop" for the "from_party" -> "to_party" edges proportions

```{r}
counts_p2p <- left_join(counts_p2p, counts_party_edges, by = 'from_party') %>%
  mutate(prop = n/n_edges) %>% 
  select(-n_edges) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop))


head(counts_p2p, 10)
```

The 'INDEP' is Jean-Marie Dedecker who ran on a N-VA list. So the high proportion of links to the N-VA is not surprising. What is interesting on the other hand is that people from the cdH tend to follow people from the MR more than they do people from their own party.  


So now Markus creates a matrix with the proportions of friends 'from_party' in rows and 'to_party' in columns.

```{r}
p2p_mat <- select(counts_p2p, -n) %>% spread(to_party, prop) %>%
    mutate_all(function(x) { ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x) })   
# some edge combinations do not occur -> replace NAs with 0
p2p_mat
```

Converting back to a data frame with the function 'gather' to use ggplot, and preparing to make a heat map. 

```{r}
counts_p2p <- gather(p2p_mat, 'to_party', 'prop', 2:ncol(p2p_mat)) %>%
  arrange(from_party, to_party) %>%
    mutate(perc = prop * 100,                     
# we use percent in the plot
           perc_label = sprintf('%.1f', perc))    
# a label to display the rounded number in the cells
head(counts_p2p, 10)

```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(counts_p2p, aes(x = to_party, y = from_party, fill = perc)) +
    geom_raster() +
    geom_text(aes(label = perc_label), color = 'white') +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(guide = 
                           guide_legend(title = 'Followers / following\nshare in percent')) +
    labs(x = 'party in column is followed by party in row', 
         y = 'party in row follows party in column',
         title = 'Proportion of followings / followers between parties',
         subtitle = paste('In percent as of', "2019-07-22")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
p

```

Remove accounts that are not connected to any other deputy account.

```{r}
accounts_connected <- unique(c(edges_parties$from_account, 
                               edges_parties$to_account))
accounts_not_connected <- dep_twitter$screen_name[!(dep_twitter$screen_name 
                                                    %in% accounts_connected)]
accounts_not_connected

```

[Dillen marijke](https://twitter.com/dillenm), seems correct, very few followers, but it might also have been a false positive. [Albert Vicaire](https://twitter.com/VicaireAlbert) looks less like a false positive, but also has very little activity. 

```{r}
dep_twitter_connected <- filter(dep_twitter, screen_name %in% accounts_connected)
```

https://igraph.org/r/doc/graph_from_data_frame.html

```{r}

vertices <- dep_twitter_connected %>% 
    select(screen_name, ln_fn, party)

#g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_parties, vertices = dep_twitter_connected)
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_parties, vertices = vertices)
g
```

So if I'm reading this right, what we've got here is 125 nodes and 2.839 links in an "igraph" object.  

So now for some graph scores. The degree score of a vertex is the number of its adjacent edges. The function 'degree' can count the in/outbound and total edges. 

```{r}
degree_score <- sort(degree(g, mode = 'total'), decreasing = TRUE)
```

So the following have the most edges:

```{r}
head(degree_score, 15)
```

And these are the parliamentarians that follow the most colleagues:

```{r}
degree_score <- sort(degree(g, mode = 'out'), decreasing = TRUE)
head(degree_score, 15)
```

And the most followed:

```{r}
betw_score <- sort(floor(betweenness(g)), decreasing = TRUE) 
degree_score <- sort(degree(g, mode = 'in'), decreasing = TRUE)
head(degree_score, 15)
```

Betweenness seems to be defined as the number of shortest paths going through a vertex. So I understand it as a measure of centrality at least in the web that is spun by the Twitter accounts. 

```{r}
graph_scores <- data.frame(screen_name = names(degree_score),
                           degr_score = degree_score,
                           betw_score = betw_score,
                           row.names = NULL, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
graph_scores <- left_join(dep_twitter_connected, graph_scores, by = 'screen_name')%>%
    mutate(full_name = ln_fn) %>%
    select(screen_name, full_name, degr_score, betw_score, party)

#graph_scores %>% arrange(desc(degree_score)) %>% head(10)
graph_scores %>% 
  arrange(desc(betw_score)) %>%
  select(-screen_name) %>% 
  head(15)

```

So the Prime Minister and President-elect of the European Council has the highest betweenness score and degree score. Find out more about betweenness  [here](https://igraph.org/r/doc/betweenness.html).  

Define the party colors. I'm sure you can improve my choice by using this [service](https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex&aqs=chrome.5.69i57j0l5.5855j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Obviously too small a picture. But you can look at a larger image [here](https://badtothecode.netlify.com/img/20190728/graph_big.png). The colors of the incoming arrows indicate which party they are from. 

And now for the interactive plot, with the visNetwork package.

```{r}
# convert igraph object to visNetwork data
vis_nw_data <- toVisNetworkData(g)

vis_nw_data$nodes$title <- sprintf('@%s (%s)', vis_nw_data$nodes$id,
                                    vis_nw_data$nodes$ln_fn)
#head(vis_nw_data$nodes)
```


```{r}
# strip transparency from edge color because visNetwork can't handle it
vis_nw_data$edges$color <- substr(vis_nw_data$edges$color, 0, 7)
#head(vis_nw_data$edges)

# create a data frame for the legend
vis_legend_data <- data.frame(label = names(party_colors), color = unname(party_colors), 
                              shape = 'square')

# create the network
vis_nw <- visNetwork(nodes = vis_nw_data$nodes, edges = vis_nw_data$edges, height = '700px',
                     width = '90%') %>%
    visIgraphLayout(layout = 'layout_with_drl', options=list(simmer.attraction=0)) %>%   
# use same layout as above
    visEdges(color = list(opacity = 0.25), arrows = 'to') %>%                            
# and same transparency
    visNodes(labelHighlightBold = TRUE, borderWidth = 1, borderWidthSelected = 12) %>%   
# set node highlighting
    visLegend(addNodes = vis_legend_data, useGroups = FALSE, zoom = FALSE, width = 0.2) %>%   
# add legend
    visOptions(nodesIdSelection = TRUE, highlightNearest = TRUE, selectedBy = 'party') %>%    
# further options
    visInteraction(dragNodes = TRUE)   # enable dragging of nodes
```


```{r message=FALSE}
visSave(vis_nw, file = "friends.html")

file.copy("friends.html", "./files/20190728/friends.html")
unlink("friends.html")

```

There is also a more organic looking dynamic version to be made using the option 'physics'.

Click [here](https://badtothecode.netlify.com/img/20190728/friends_ll) for the more 'organic' interactive graph. I enjoy this one too. When you click on some parlemantairians with average or below average degree scores, you get an immediate visualisation of their personal filter bubble. Or rather, their professional filter bubble.

Thank you for your attention.
