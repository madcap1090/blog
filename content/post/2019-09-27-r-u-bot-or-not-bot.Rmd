If you have a Twitter account chances are one day you had a new follower that you did not know and that felt a bit off. Maybe the account has few followers, a lot or no tweets, recent created profile, Not followed by anyone you're following, or likely a combination of the above.  

Or you just cannot understand why that account should want to follow you because you have no connections to it whatsoever. 

It is likely that these accounts are managed by bots using the Twitter API. Since it is estimated that up to 15% of profiles on Twitter are controled by bots and that there has been a lot of speculation on their political influence through their propagation of propaganda, there has been a large number of studies and analysis into that fenomenon. A whole range of tools can be applied, supervised learning, network & cluster analysis, time series, NLP...  

But in this post I will try to detect and analyse bots following a randomly chosen Twitter friend. 

In Twitter parlance a follower is someone who is following your tweets and a friend is an account you follow.
