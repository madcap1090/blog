<p>I was looking for a way to have the same level of analysis of Facebook that is possible with the Twitter API, but gave up after a short while. The API seems to me quite closed in terms of what information is made available by Facebook.</p>
<p>So I was quiet interested when I come across <a href="http://rpubs.com/zoowalk/FB_EP2019">this</a> blog post of Mr Schmidt not on an API for Facebook generally, but for Facebook ads.</p>
<p>The increased transparency comes as a reaction against criticism on Facebook for running ‘manipulative’ political adds (lies) on it’s servers.</p>
<p>Let’s have a go at it (and thank you Mr. Schmidt ) and see what we can come up with related to the Belgian elections of May 2019 or more widely regarding Belgian political messages.</p>
<p>I am far from being an expert in Facebook advertising, so this is a blog on learning more about what we can get out of the API even though some are quite critical about the information it offers. See for instance <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/04/29/facebooks-ad-archive-api-is-inadequate/">Facebook’s Ad Archive API is Inadequate</a>.</p>
<p>And amid new leaks reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/cambridge-analytica-data-leak-global-election-manipulation">today</a> that show the vast extent of manipulation trough Facebook it seems important to have a closer look at what can be learned from the data Facebook provides.</p>

<p>The way to go about is to go to Facebook for developers by creating an account and then create a new app. Add all the search fields you are interested in (I took all) and you then need a token that seems to be a temporary token (on this <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/">portal</a>), meaning that it is only valid for a certain time and you need to re-generate it for your next run.</p>

<p>This returned 18K rows when I ran it 4 months ago. We are more than doubling the rows today, which is good news. It could have been that the archive only returned results on a rolling time window basis, but that does not seem to be the case, so more data to us.</p>
<p>We received 16 columns. Some of them contain lists.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(df_imp)</code></pre>

<p>It will be easier if we have a custom function that extracts the date from the different time stamps.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>make_date &lt;- function(x){
  ymd(str_sub(x,1,10))

df_imp &lt;- df_imp %&gt;%
  mutate(ad_creation_day = make_date(ad_creation_time),
         ad_delivery_start_day = make_date(ad_delivery_start_time),
         ad_delivery_stop_day = make_date(ad_delivery_stop_time))</code></pre>
<p>The archive starts at:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>min(df_imp$ad_delivery_start_day)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2014-05-12&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And ends today:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>max(df_imp$ad_delivery_start_day)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2020-01-04&quot;</code></pre>
<p>But I suspect the number of ads of the ‘politics and issues’ category we obtained are not evenly spread between these two dates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_imp %&gt;%

<p>So yes, very few until 2019, at least in the results we obtained with the api calls. This does not mean that there were not many in the past, it’s just the data we got given to work with.</p>
<p>The first dozens of ads were from the The European Democratic Party (EDP), the first ad from a Belgian political party started being delivered on 02/06/2017 and was from the N-VA:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_imp %&gt;% 
  filter(ad_delivery_start_day == ymd(&quot;2017-06-02&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(ad_delivery_start_day, ad_creative_body) %&gt;%
  slice(1) %&gt;% 
  datatable(class = &#39;compact&#39;, escape = TRUE, options = list(dom  = &#39;t&#39;))</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1"],["2017-06-02"],["Mét de N-VA eindelijk maatregelen tegen sociale-zekerheidstoerisme.

<p>Glad to hear the change works, but I guess that means the end of going to Romania for my dental work.</p>
<p>Analyzing the global figures a bit further and getting the total ads per funding entity:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_imp %&gt;% 
  count(funding_entity,
        sort = TRUE,
        name = &quot;total ads&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 940 x 2

<p>We learn that most of the ads have no funding entity and that there are more UNICEF ads than ads for the party “Vlaams Belang”.</p>
<p>It is indeed a pity that Facebook decided to put the ‘political’ and ‘issues’ categories in one bag. Furthermore, these categories are not based on the type of message, ad, but on the type of funding entity or page. This means that different rules apply on ‘issues’ entities and business entities.</p>
<p>In other words we have access to what Greenpeace Belgium is advertising in Belgium through Facebook, but not what Exxon Mobile is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/?source=archive-landing-page">Because</a> as stated by Facebook: “Default value:”POLITICAL_AND_ISSUE_ADS“:
The type of ad. We label either all returned ads as political or issue ads, or label ads for news related to politics or issues of political importance. See Facebook Ads Help Center, About ads related to politics or issues of national importance. We currently only support POLITICAL_AND_ISSUE_ADS.” Note that the options listed are: ALL, POLITICAL_AND_ISSUE_ADS, HOUSING_ADS, UNCATEGORIZED_ADS.</p>
<p>(I’m not really holding my breath for the housing adds.)</p>
<p>Facebook’s ads archive library is not only flawed, it is also biased because it does not include any corporate advertising. We might have a glimpse at what Belgian political parties spent and whatever their messages were, but we do not know how much was spent in Belgium flogging the F35 by Northrop Grumman for instance. And some commentators say that is exactly one of the reasons why Facebook is reluctant to be transparent. The more it is forced to be transparent on political ads and their impact on democracy, the more they will be under pressure to reveal the agenda of their corporate clients. As nicely explained in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/09YkfvCUGsegLYgzMYrtvi?si=LniDF1c3QGezA9cmUERyfQ">this Guardian postcast</a></p>
<p>For now we have to do with what is given to us. Also with the fact that more than half of these ads have no known sponsors even though Facebook itself is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/208949576550051">claiming</a> “For general or national-level elections taking place in the European Union (such as the general election in Spain, the federal election in Belgium and the presidential election in Lithuania), political parties and candidates campaigning in these elections will be required to complete ad authorisations and place”Paid for by" disclaimers on all of their ads until the end of the election period."</p>
<p>Maybe the “Paid for by” appeared on all of their ads until the election period. Or they did not but here are the ads by unknown funding entity and by date in 2019:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_imp %&gt;% 
  filter(ad_creation_day &gt; ymd(&quot;2018-12-31&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  filter(is.na(funding_entity)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(ad_delivery_start_day) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n_ads=n()) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n_ads)) %&gt;%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x= ad_delivery_start_day,
               y=n_ads
               ),
           #color=&quot;transparent&quot;,
           stat=&quot;identity&quot;
           )+
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-01-04-political-ads-on-facebook-for-the-2019-belgian-elections_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So we can safely say some of these ads were run during the election period, and it might be interesting to have a closer look at the ads without known funding entity, by looking at the page name they are financing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_imp %&gt;% 
  filter(is.na(funding_entity)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(page_name) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  select(page_name, count) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(count))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3,396 x 2
##    page_name          count
##    &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;
##  1 UNICEF Belgium       946
##  2 De Morgen            641
##  3 Kialo                484
##  4 Flamingos&#39; Life      408
##  5 Peter Mertens        322
##  6 Òmnium Cultural      221
##  7 Greenpeace Belgium   198
##  8 Slush                181
##  9 Pela Case            140
## 10 Pride Palace         136
## # ... with 3,386 more rows</code></pre>
<p>So here in the top ten, except for Mr. Mertens, there are no political actors. Only ‘issues’ like the UN agency UNICEF, a news outlet and others.</p>
<p>This means that if we want to create any meaningful analysis of political ads on Facebook for Belgium based on this data set there is not a small amount of data cleaning to be done. Tbh we are used to that, but not in a data set that would have have been specifically designed to be a basis for analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s try to only keep politicians and parties. But before we do we will have a look at the estimation of total expenses for Belgium in 2019, per page. We do not have exact numbers of amounts spent only a range per ad. Here are the ranges:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sort(as.numeric(unique(unlist(df_imp$spend))))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]       0      99     100     199     200     299     300     399

<p>Russia critising a possible withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is such a 2019 thing to do.</p>
<p>And the set of ads paid in rubles also contains what looks to be ads against Bart De Wever (the president of the N-VA), or click-bait, by these pages:</p>

<p>Rather weird. But it might be more interesting to see what ads had the biggest budgets. We need to convert to a common currency to compare the amounts spent. Let us get today’s exchange rates to the euro of the currencies in our data frame.</p>

<p>So the Vlaams Belang takes first and second place, bearing in mind that the European Parliament spreads its ads over a much wider range of regions (hundreds, and there are three in Belgium).</p>
<p>And here is an estimation of what was spent in rubles on these De Wever ads:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_spent %&gt;%
  filter(currency == &quot;RUB&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(ad_creative_body, &quot;Wever&quot;)) %&gt;%

  sum()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5850.191</code></pre>
<p>6K€ is not that much compared to the others, but too much to be a mere prank.</p>
<p>What was the reach of these ads/pages? Or rather we have a range of impressions per ad (the number of times the content was displayed to a target audience).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_reach &lt;- df_spent %&gt;%
  rename(lower_spent = lower_bound) %&gt;%

<p>This means that the ads of the N-VA and sp.a have had a bigger number of impressions than the page of Tom Van Grieken, despite having spent less money on them. Having said that reach and clicks are also important metrics to evaluate marketing impact, but we just do not have that data.</p>
<p>Next to ‘issue’ pages there are also businesses in the list, like for instance Garnier. They cannot really be categorised as an issue organisation.</p>

<p>One strategy to get only the political actors is to filter on the pages or funding entities that have a political party name in them. But some politicians do not mention in their page name for which party they are a candidate for. So all the candidates names are also needed.</p>
<p>Let’s do some scraping from an official election site.</p>

Volgende afspraak: het ledencongres in december, tot dan!","🚧 Situation sur les travaux de la Rue du Grand Marais\n\n🗣 Retrouvez le texte de mon interpellation destinée à l’Échevin des travaux lors du conseil communal du 8 octobre:\n\n« Monsieur l’Échevin des Travaux, \n\nComme vous le savez, la rue du Grand Marais située à Ghlin a fait l’objet de travaux de réfection de voirie assez récemment. Mais, la population et nous regrettons que cela ne se soit pas passé de manière optimale.\n\nCes travaux ont duré assez longtemps – plus ou moins 8 mois. L’entrepreneur ne prévenait pas les habitants de ses actions de manière anticipative ce qui a mené à ce que plusieurs voitures soient coincées dans les allées de garage. Une partie de route au croisement de la rue du Grand Marais et du Chemin vert n°7 est béante depuis plus d’un an et demi. De plus, les habitants ont connu des ouvertures continues pour le gaz, l’électricité, internet… Des dégradations sont apparues au niveau des trottoirs à cause de cela. Les travaux sont à l’origine de vibrations et celles-ci ont fissuré certains bâtiments. Le niveau entre les deux sens de la rue risque d’abimer les voitures des citoyens. L’écoulement de l’eau n’est, en plus, pas efficace.\n\nVous le constatez: cette réfection a engendré tellement de désagréments que certains ne souhaitent même pas que l’autre coté de la rue soit aménagé.\n\nDès lors, pourriez-vous m’indiquer si l’entreprise Wanty et/ou ses sous-traitants ont bien respecté les conditions de marché et le cahier des charges y afférent ?\n\nPour l’instant, seul un coté de la rue a été refait. Cela engendre ce que les riverains appellent « la conduite à l’anglaise » puisque les conducteurs roulent à contre-sens pour profiter de la voirie refaite – ce qui génère des problèmes évidents de sécurité.\n\nSe pose alors la question de savoir quand est-ce que l’autre coté de la route va être refait. Cela nécessite-il une inscription au prochain budget ? Pourriez-vous m’indiquer si cela est prévu et également à quelle échéance les travaux seront réalisés ?\n\nIl y a quelques temps, une réunion d’information au sujet de la possible intégration d’un égouttage avait eu lieu. Lors d’un précédant conseil communal, vous m’avez indiqué que cette rue ne ferait pas partie des prochains investissements de la Ville. Maintenant qu’une partie de la route a été remplacée, cela ne parait plus très opportun. Pouvez-vous me le confirmer ?\n\nCes travaux me permettent également d’attirer votre attention sur les problématiques rencontrées par ce quartier. La route étant une longue ligne droite, les voitures y roulent  – enfin, lorsqu’elles le peuvent – généralement de manière trop rapide ; plus encore, les vendredis et samedis soirs dû à l’activité du Restaurant Petit Marais Grill. D’autres dispositifs ralentisseurs que celui devant l’ancienne école du Long Coron sont-ils en préparation ?\n\nLe site de l’ancienne école du Long Coron continue de se dégrader. À Mons en Mieux, nous soutenons l’idée d’y implanter une crèche tant les places tendent à manquer pour les parents de notre ville. Ce projet ou d’autres sont-ils envisagés ? À quelle échéance le site sera-t-il réhabilité et réutilisé ?\n\nQui plus est, la Quewette qui reliait Ghlin à Jemappes est fermée depuis de nombreuses années. Cet endroit est devenu un lieu de décharge sauvage et un endroit idéal pour le trafic de drogue. Serait-il possible que les services communaux interviennent sur ces deux thématiques ?\n\nJe vous remercie pour votre attention. »\n\n🤝 Si vous faites face à ce genre de situation, n’hésitez pas à contacter un membre de l’équipe Mons en Mieux. Nous sommes à votre écoute.","🤠 Ce week-end, avec Florent Dufrane de la team Mons en Mieux, je participais à la soirée country organisée par l’Entraide de Ghlin à la Maison du Peuple de la Bouverie. \n\n🤔 Mais l’Entraide de Ghlin, c’est quoi ?\n\n🤝 L’Entraide vient en aide à toutes les personnes qui sont dans le besoin - et pas forcément que pour les Ghlinoises et les Ghlinois. \n\n👍🏻 Elle organise un soutien moral, une aide, un accompagnement avec une assistante sociale. Un service d’insertion sociale (avec des ateliers cuisine, ateliers créatifs, sorties culturelles, sport ou relaxation) fait partie de l’action de l’Entraide.\n\n🧼 🧖🏽‍♂️ Une équipe spécialisée s’occupe du bien-être de tous pour (re)prendre confiance en soi. \n\n🥕🧽 Il y a également un service d’aide alimentaire et un lavoir social. \n\n👗👞🧤 Et finalement, il y a la boutique de seconde main « La Trouvaille » située Rue de Mons, 97 à 7011 Ghlin où il y a vêtements et objets du quotidien à des prix abordables pour tout un chacun.\n\nSi vous souhaitez les aider, vous pouvez soit 1️⃣ devenir bénévole soit 2️⃣ faire des dons de vêtements ou objets pour La Trouvaille, ou encore 3️⃣ faire un don 💰","🤯 De regering gaat mensen geld afnemen maar het is niet duidelijk hoeveel en van wie.

Dat is het gevolg van het nieuw Vlaams regeerakkoord waarbij de gemeenten extra budget krijgen o.a. omwille van hun open ruimte. \nWe vernemen uit de entourage van Minister-President Jan Jambon dat voor Zonnebeke dit concreet 2 495 733 euro betekent. \n\nN-VA Zonnebeke: “Met dit geld kunnen we onze gemeente écht beter maken. Wij stellen voor dat de gemeente bij voorkeur investeert in de aanleg en onderhoud van fietspaden. Vele fietspaden zijn niet onderhouden en verkeren in een erbarmelijk staat! Wij denken bijvoorbeeld aan het fietspad in de Langemarkstraat waar het momenteel ronduit gevaarlijk fietsen is. ”\n\nHiermee kunnen we nu eindelijk ook de nodige budgetten vrijmaken om een degelijk en weldoordacht mobiliteitsplan te maken.

Avant tout un immense merci pour les très nombreuses marques de soutien. Cela me touche profondément.\n\nComme vous le savez maintenant, je suis candidat à la présidence du MR - Mouvement Réformateur.\n\nPourquoi avoir posé ce choix ? À l’heure où la société évolue de plus en plus rapidement, où les défis sont nombreux, je compte bien apporter mon dévouement sans limite, mon énergie et une vision moderne dans la gestion du parti tout en m’appuyant sur l’expérience et les talents de Willy Borsus, Sophie Wilmes et Pierre-Yves Jeholet ainsi que l’ensemble de nos chefs de groupes, élus et collaborateurs. \n\nÀ ce titre, ma jeunesse est un atout pour intégrer un monde nouveau qui s’ouvre à nous. Mariée à l’expérience de mes collègues, cela permettra à notre équipe de mieux se déployer et d’être plus efficace. Comme au football, où les joueurs ne doivent pas tous avoir les mêmes qualités, c’est dans la diversité des profils que nous pourront extraire le meilleur de chacun. \n\nD’autant que mon parcours militant est déjà ancien ! Engagé au MR depuis 2005, j’ai été conseiller au cabinet de Didier Reynders durant quatre ans, ensuite Echevin de la Ville de Mons et député wallon. La campagne 2019 marque un tournant grâce à l’expérience acquise aux côtés de Charles Michel. Désormais délégué général du MR et Sénateur, j’ai travaillé étape par étape, venant d’une famille totalement étrangère à la politique. De 14ème candidat sur une liste communale à Mons à candidat à la présidence aujourd’hui.\n\nSi je me permets cette impudeur de dévoiler ces quelques éléments personnels, c’est pour illustrer à quel point le mouvement libéral et réformateur est en moi. Cette candidature n’est pas un hasard, c’est le fruit d’un long cheminement, fait de nombreux coups durs mais aussi de succès collectifs.\n\nAlors aujourd’hui, je veux porter avec vous le projet libéral et réformateur, l’expliquer sur le terrain pour que chacun sache qu’il est le seul à être émancipateur, le seul qui permet à un individu de quitter ses conditions d’origine pour choisir la vie qu’il désire. Nous devons pour ce faire garantir l’égalité des possibles. Pas une liberté sans encadrement ou une égalité théorique. Mais bien la possibilité pour tous d’avoir les outils d’exercer effectivement cette liberté et d’avoir véritablement les moyens de poser de véritables choix.\n\nC’est la raison pour laquelle, dans un monde de plus en plus complexe, l’enseignement devra être la première politique des libéraux et réformateurs. Celle qui doit donner les clés pour comprendre et appréhender le monde.\n\nCette campagne sera aussi l’occasion d’aborder les questions d’organisation interne du mouvement. Avec la création d’un parlement interne des élus locaux, la prise en charge de sujets concrets par différentes personnalités réformatrices et débattus avec les membres, une communication interne et externe revue, ...\n\nJe compte bien développer et débattre ces propositions concrètes avec vous. Dès lors, n’hésitez pas à poser vos questions ou à proposer une réunion à la maison ou au sein de votre section en envoyant un courriel à georges-louis@glbouchez.be \n\nNous devrons maintenant poser des choix, ceux-ci devront être audacieux car le conservatisme ne nous permettra pas d’incarner le progrès auquel nous aspirons. Soyons optimistes car le projet libéral et réformateur est porteur d’espérance dans la confiance qu’il fait en l’Homme.\n\nLe parti libéral est le plus vieux d’Europe, créé en 1846 au sein du salon gothique de l’hôtel de Ville de Bruxelles, où la photo de lancement de campagne a été prise, nos racines sont fortes. C’est pourquoi nous devons avoir les pieds dans l’Histoire et les mains tendues vers l’avenir.\n\nTotalement engagé à vos côtés, ayez l’audace de l’optimisme !","Ranst staat voor een grote uitdaging op het vlak van \n✔️ openbare verlichting ✔️ milieu ✔️ energiebesparing.\n\nDOEL 2️⃣0️⃣3️⃣0️⃣  \nAlle openbare verlichting = ledverlichting.\nWe versnellen de ombouw van de energieverslindende openbare verlichting. \n\nOm dit te realiseren sloot het gemeentebestuur een overeenkomst met distributienetbeheerder IVEKA.\n\nWe zorgen zo voor:\n✅ minder verbruik\n✅ minder CO²-uitstoot\n✅ verlaging van de gemeentelijke energiekosten","Retrouvez l'interview, sans langue de bois, de Catherine Moureaux, Rachid Madrane et moi-même.

<p>The data can be further subsetted by one of the three Belgian regions but that is where it ends. Facebook is not transparent enough to present the categories that are used to micro target political messages. And that is an important missing element.</p>

<p>If accurate at all we can only infer some general trends from what we obtained.</p>
<p>In a future post I will be analysing the ad texts themselves. Let’s see what we can learn from those!</p>
