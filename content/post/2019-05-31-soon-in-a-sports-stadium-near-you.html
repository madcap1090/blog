<p>When I showed a colleague of mine the last <a href="https://badtothecode.netlify.com/post/metallica-rules-the-world/">post</a>, he suggested to construct an animated map with the geo location of the different Metallica concerts. By the way it turns out that the guy also sometimes enjoys being a metalhead. We both were right in front of the stage at Dessel on the 6th June 2015 for the last concert of AC/DC in Belgium, that is more than three years before we first met.</p>

<p>That is a coincidence. We could have found out if we had compared our Google location <a href="https://badtothecode.netlify.com/post/google-location-tracking/">history</a>. Hmm, an app could be made to do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to a map &amp; Metallica. Challenge accepted, Mr. Goodyear.</p>

<p>Et voilà, an animated world map with the geo locations of Metallica’s concert. Don’t ask me to change the color of the little dots :smiling_imp:</p>
