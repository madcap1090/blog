<p>Another tool to analyse our text data with is topic modeling. This might seem similar to the tf-idf calculations but the biggest difference in topic modeling is that here we will see if we can learn something by seeing which words tend to be used in the same reviews. While the tf-idf only looks at the occurrence of the word compared to the total occurrences of all the other words.</p>
<p>I got the guidance for the wrangling the data from an article by Igor Hut <a href="https://rpubs.com/MajstorMaestro/256588">here</a> and also the article by Dmitriy Selivanov. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/text2vec/vignettes/text-vectorization.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Further inspiration and guidance came from <a href="https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/topic-modeling/">Chicago U</a>.</p>

library(&quot;cld2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Our data is, like you remember, a data frame with 3.978 rows with one column containing the 154.896 reviews (spread over the different rows of the beers).
What we want to use is a document term matrix (dtm), with one row per beer and a column per (cleaned and filtered) word. The values inside the matrix can be the number of times the word appears or another calculation (like the tf_idf).</p>

<p>The last three words in the review are probably inserted automatically; the user name, the number of characters, and month of the review. So we can calculate the number of reviews per user and then filter out these last three words too.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>users &lt;- input_cleaned %&gt;% 
  mutate(n_words = str_count(comments, &#39;\\w+&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(user= word(comments,n_words-1)) %&gt;% #taking all but the last three words
  select(user, n_words, comments)

users %&gt;% group_by(user) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(count))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 14,595 x 2
##    user          count
##    &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;

<p>So these top ones have been quite prolific. Looking at the number of reviews published by all the users (were still only on the Belgian beers only by the way) we get a long-tail shape:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_users &lt;- users %&gt;% 
  group_by(user) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %&gt;% 
  filter(count &gt; 1 &amp; count &lt; 400)

ggplot(df_users, aes(x=reorder(user, -count), y=count)) + 
         geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, fill  =&quot;steelblue&quot;) +
  #scale_y_continuous(trans=&quot;log10&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-12-12-topic-modeling-beer-reviews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And the beer types that got the most reviews are the following ones:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>users_type &lt;- input_cleaned %&gt;% 
  mutate(n_words = str_count(comments, &#39;\\w+&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(user= word(comments,n_words-1)) %&gt;% #taking all but the last three words
  select(user, n_words, comments, beer_type)

top_10 &lt;- users_type %&gt;% group_by(beer_type) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %&gt;% 
  head(10)

top_10 %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(beer_type, count), y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=0.6, fill= &quot;steelblue&quot;) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x=NULL) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-12-12-topic-modeling-beer-reviews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can clean the text further, only keeping English reviews, and removing the usernames and the months from the reviews, and get rid of small or empty reviews :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>input_cleaned &lt;- input_cleaned %&gt;%
  mutate(language = detect_language(text = comments)) %&gt;% 
  filter(language == &quot;en&quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(-language)

input_cleaned &lt;- input_cleaned %&gt;% 
  mutate(n_words = str_count(comments, &#39;\\w+&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(review= word(comments, 1, n_words-2)) %&gt;% 
  select(-comments) %&gt;% 
  filter(nchar(review) &gt; 25)

it_all &lt;- itoken(unlist(input_cleaned$review),
                        tokenizer = word_tokenizer,
                        ids = input_cleaned$i)

# removing some words along with stop words
stop_words &lt;- stopwords(kind = &quot;en&quot;)

remove_words &lt;- c(stop_words,
                  &quot;s&quot;,&quot;m&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;ve&quot;,&quot;st&quot;, &quot;review&quot;, &quot;one&quot;,
                  &quot;t&quot;, &quot;cl&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;ml&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;bit&quot;,
                  &quot;characters&quot;, &quot;beer&quot;, &quot;bottle&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, 
                  &quot;head&quot;, &quot;beers&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;oz&quot;)

vocabulary &lt;- create_vocabulary(it_all,
                                stopwords = remove_words,)

vocabulary %&gt;% arrange(desc(term_count)) %&gt;%
  slice(1:1250) %&gt;%

<p>This matrix has a row per document and all the terms (76K) in th columns.</p>
<p>We know we have between 15 and 20 big beer type categories from the previous post. So we might reasonably assume the optimal number of topics might be in the same range. There are however more objective ways to calculate the optimal number of topics.

<p>The ‘get_top_words’ function gives the most relevant words in the topics (with lambda = 0.4), but does not return a relevance score. So digging into the function to see if we can obtain it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lambda &lt;- 0.4
n &lt;- 15
topic_word_distribution &lt;- lda_model$topic_word_distribution
topic_word_freq &lt;- lambda * log(topic_word_distribution) +

  top_n(5, relevance) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  arrange(topic, -relevance)

<p>We then can plot these scores:</p>

  tidytext::scale_x_reordered() +
  facet_wrap(~ order, scales = &quot;free&quot;, ncol = 3) +
  coord_flip() +

have been trying to get out of my hoppcentric ways seems to affect how beers w o hopps taste and sometimes i m to negative to them now i ve decided to just drink more of the styles at a time to compare cheers to more tasting","this is a good belgian blonde ale nice flavor drinks well from a glass and it s on sale at my local supermarket for a six pack what more could you ask for","this is a world famous beer but i was not impressed with this at all it is way too sweet especially with food the color is yellowish copper and the smell is not so great i don t taste much hops in this beer very malty i definitely won t be trying this beer again","its ok but i don t think its anything outstanding but i don t think its meant to be a bit sweet and one of the more commercial abbey blond style belgian ales","purchased this one in a supermarket so this is leffe attempt at an ipa i was expecting more from this one go for other leffe products if you re an aficionados otherwise i won t buy again not too mention it s pricey","as most leffe this is a very yeasty brew strong abv pretty drinkable liked the color smell and taste ovbisously reminiscent of leffe blonde probably better","nice looking beer decent nose flavor profile is good this is what a triple should taste like seems slightly hot it s a nice drinker and it s consistent yes but not overly inspiring still nice to be able to try something from belgium that works so few belgian ales to try it seems or maybe it s because i live where i do","i am generally not a fan of belgian beers so do not hold my opinion against it i found it to have the distinct european skunky taste that i associate with all the green bottled beers like heineken and stella i am trying to get into better beers but this just doesn t do it for me","from hipercor last units in la trappe chalice playing memoria suprisingly good for its low price at the level of other more expensive belgian abbey beers","quality beer although not in the same class as its contemporaries in belgium this is considered sub par in canada this would beat most of the local beer","i ve been eyeing this beer for a while but never picked it up before tonight from the nose it is quite pungent with a funky belgian smell taste it s really not as bitter as i was expecting but it s a nice smooth belgian ipa would drink again","this brew just didn t impress me poured with almost no head and was very light looking almost clear it had more of a smell than aroma imo sort of skunky and it didn t remind me of any pale i had ever tried but the worst thing about the beer was the awful after taste the first belgian that i have tried that i won t drink again cheers","one of the best beers i had in belgium would have loved to tour the brewery and try it that way was a nice pour and had a nice head on the beer certainly fit the characteristics of a belgium beer","maybe i have too many good local microbreweries with plenty of belgians to choose from but i was utterly disappointed with this beer i prefer a sweet beligian so maybe if you enjoy a tasteless flavorless non descript belgian ale then this is definitely the beer for you if you don t have local belgians try urthel before you try this this beer is really way overrated on this website","had this on draft last night i enjoyed it it didn t blow me away but it was tasty very solid for the style definitely something i d order again though this isn t my favorite style and i m not overly crazy about belgian beers m j","from uvinum in teku glass playing unepic reminds me their delirium tremens maybe a step below with less taste but good and easy drinking anyway","i don t understand all the negative reviews about this beer bocholt is far better than american lager beers very smooth great aroma taste and flavor","don t be fooled by the belgian brewery and the malt s t it s a fad this is a happoshu a fake beer made for japan has nothing to do with belgian beers what is has is metallic aroma watered down taste and will give you a headache not recommended","for those who appreciate a fine hefe look elsewhere if you want a decent enough session beer and are against macro lagers this is a good bet if you are in korea i d recommend this over lotte s l weizen","a good belgian strong pale ale as hundreds in the style don t be mistaken it s nowhere as good as the duvel chouffe or delirium but worthy of a try cheers","this dismal ale was the only alternative to heineken in amsterdam airport watery and tasteless borderline drinkable but would choose pretty much anything belgian over this his royal","nothing so special a normal belgian ale and not so drinkable in my opinion nothing so special a normal belgian ale and not so drinkable in my opinion nothing so

not that disappointing but it was kind of like that i enjoyed it although it was not spectacular to the palete","meh was given to me as a gift never would have bought it for myself really not

<p>We obtain per topic and per beer type the sum of the topic scores of the reviews with the highest scores per topic. And that’s a bit of a mouthful, but we can plot them (also excluding the smaller topics).</p>

<p>I like this way of presenting things even if interpretation needs to be a bit careful. The plot makes the topics a a bit more palatable as it were.</p>
<p>There is still is a s*** avenues to explore with topic modeling and I’m sure we will get back to them, but this post is already a bit too long so concluding with the mapping of the 20 most commented beers with the same analysis frame.</p>

<p>So here again we can see which beers are in the highly rated topic (8).</p>
<p>See you next time, cheers.</p>
