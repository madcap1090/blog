      <description>If you have a Twitter account chances are one day you had a new follower that you did not know and that felt a bit odd. Maybe the account had few followers, a lot or no tweets, had been recently created, is not followed by anyone you’re following, or likely a combination of the above.
It is also likely that these accounts are managed by bots using the Twitter API.</description>

      <description>In the last post we tried hard to find out all the Twitter handles of our current parliamentarians. A number of interesting analyses can be done with the texts they tweet. But the legislature is quite young and since there still is no federal government and that we are in summer break there are not enough tweets to have interesting analyses at this moment.
One of the things we can analyse now are the links on Twitter between members of parliament as demonstrated by the excellent blog posts/code of Markus Konrad starting here</description>
