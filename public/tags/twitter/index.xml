      <description>If you have a Twitter account chances are one day you had a new follower that you did not know and that felt a bit odd. Maybe the account had few followers, a lot or no tweets, had been recently created, is not followed by anyone you’re following, or likely a combination of the above.
It is also likely that these accounts are managed by bots using the Twitter API.</description>

      <description>In the last post we tried hard to find out all the Twitter handles of our current parliamentarians. A number of interesting analyses can be done with the texts they tweet. But the legislature is quite young and since there still is no federal government and that we are in summer break there are not enough tweets to have interesting analyses at this moment.
One of the things we can analyse now are the links on Twitter between members of parliament as demonstrated by the excellent blog posts/code of Markus Konrad starting here</description>

      <description>On 20/06/2019 the new chamber of representative was constituted for the 55th legislature. There are a fair number of new members in this assembly. In this post we will get their Twitter handles if they have one. This will make it possible to get their tweets and information about their accounts to be used in various analyses.
The process can get a tiny bit tedious because as far as I know there is no website regrouping the handles, we need to search for them using the rtweet package, roughly in the same way in which it was done for the last legislature.</description>

      <description>When trying to find an interface between AWS and Rekognition in a previous post, I was unsuccessful in finding a suitable R library. But today I (partially) caught up with my email backlog and was excited to find in the newsletter from rweekly, that a number of interesting R packages just came out at the beginning of the month.
As far as I understand at the moment, there are 11 packages bundled in a kit published three days ago…</description>

      <description>In the last post we were pretty successful in getting our parliamentarians Twitter handles. We can now use these to download their tweets.
The twitter API allows to download 3200 tweets per handle. This means that we will not be able to download all tweets of all parliamentarians from the last five years, because some of them tweeted more than 3200 during that time period. But there will be a fair amount.</description>

      <description>Now that we can scrape the names of the parliamentarians of the 54th legislature, we can try to find their Twitter accounts too.
Let’s start by reconstructing the list. Then we can search Twitter for their accounts handles. A bit of grunt work and no visuals in this post, but it is needed to harvest parlaimentarians’ tweets soonish.
Starting with attaching libraries, and in particular ‘rtweet’.
