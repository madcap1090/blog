      <description>I was looking for a way to have the same level of analysis of Facebook that is possible with the Twitter API, but gave up after a short while. The API seems to me quite closed in terms of what information is made available by Facebook.
So I was quiet interested when I come across this blog post of Mr Schmidt not on an API for Facebook generally, but for Facebook ads.</description>

      <description>Another tool to analyse our text data with is topic modeling. This might seem similar to the tf-idf calculations but the biggest difference in topic modeling is that here we will see if we can learn something by seeing which words tend to be used in the same reviews. While the tf-idf only looks at the occurrence of the word compared to the total occurrences of all the other words.</description>
