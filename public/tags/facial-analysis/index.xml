      <description>In an earlier post we scraped the pictures of parliamentarians and used Recognition to analyses their faces. It’s time to look a little bit closer at the data, test the usage of the ‘gather’ and ‘spread’ function and get to know ggplot a little bit more.
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;magick&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggthemes&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;extrafont&amp;quot;)Here are the different features we now have available. On the side of the observations (rows), it might be best to take a snapshot (at the end of the legislation) in order to have a slightly more objective representation.</description>

      <description>Remember we downloaded the pictures of our parliamentarians and made a patchwork with them? I looked for a while how to analyse them for gender, age and skin color. One obvious candidate was Rekognition from AWS if only because the instances at my workplace decided to use AWS services. Getting a little bit more familiar with using these seemed therefore like a good choice.
I searched for R packages to use Rekognition with, but did not find any.</description>
