      <description>On 20/06/2019 the new chamber of representative was constituted for the 55th legislature. There are a fair number of new members in this assembly. In this post we will get their Twitter handles if they have one. This will make it possible to get their tweets and information about their accounts to be used in various analyses.
The process can get a tiny bit tedious because as far as I know there is no website regrouping the handles, we need to search for them using the rtweet package, roughly in the same way in which it was done for the last legislature.</description>

      <description>They say there is a Chinese curse that says ‘may you live in interesting times’. The results of the elections are in and they are, wel… interesting.
The part about ‘living in interesting times’ coming from China might however be fake.
The results of the federal parliamentarian elections have also been posted on Wikipedia. All the past results can also be found there, so the idea behind this post is to have an understanding of the evolution in Belgian politics through the evolution of the composition of the federal chamber.</description>

      <description>23 days till Metallica hits the Koning Boudewijnstadion in Belgium. High time to get loaded with some Metallica data. There is an interesting site called setlist that publishes setlists of loads of bands and indeed also of Metallica. It also lists the name of the tour, the venues and the dates. Pretty cool stuff that can be scraped and analysed.
And the site even says it cares about our privacy, that is just perfect!</description>

      <description>For a country as small as Belgium 6 governments is a lot. It’s maybe because we Belgians like to be governed and governed well. Why else would we want to pay for 6 governments, their administration and their parliaments?
We also love politicians, so we want to have many. I also like politicians and decided to do some NLP on their tweets. But since there are a significant number of politicians in Belgium I searched for an objective criteria to define a subset.</description>
