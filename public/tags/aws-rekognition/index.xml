      <description>When trying to find an interface between AWS and Rekognition in a previous post, I was unsuccessful in finding a suitable R library. But today I (partially) caught up with my email backlog and was excited to find in the newsletter from rweekly, that a number of interesting R packages just came out at the beginning of the month.
As far as I understand at the moment, there are 11 packages bundled in a kit published three days ago…</description>

      <description>In an earlier post we scraped the pictures of parliamentarians and used Rekognition to analyses their faces. It’s time to look a little bit closer at the data, test the usage of the ‘gather’ and ‘spread’ function and get to know ggplot a little bit more.
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;magick&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggthemes&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;extrafont&amp;quot;)Here are the different features we now have available. On the side of the observations (rows), it might be best to take a snapshot (at the end of the legislation) in order to have a slightly more objective representation.</description>

      <description>Remember we downloaded the pictures of our parliamentarians and made a patchwork with them? I looked for a while how to analyse them for gender, age and skin color. One obvious candidate was Rekognition from AWS if only because the instances at my workplace decided to use AWS services. Getting a little bit more familiar with using these seemed therefore like a good choice.
I searched for R packages to use Rekognition with, but did not find any.</description>
