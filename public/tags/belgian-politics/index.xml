      <description>They say there is a Chinese curse that says ‘may you live in interesting times’. The results of the elections are in and they are, wel… interesting.
The part about ‘living in interesting times’ coming from China might however be fake.
The results of the federal parliamentarian elections have also been posted on Wikipedia. All the past results can also be found there, so the idea behind this post is to have an understanding of the evolution in Belgian politics through the evolution of the composition of the federal chamber.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post we scraped the pictures of parliamentarians and used Rekognition to analyses their faces. It’s time to look a little bit closer at the data, test the usage of the ‘gather’ and ‘spread’ function and get to know ggplot a little bit more.
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;magick&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggthemes&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;extrafont&amp;quot;)Here are the different features we now have available. On the side of the observations (rows), it might be best to take a snapshot (at the end of the legislation) in order to have a slightly more objective representation.</description>

      <description>Remember we downloaded the pictures of our parliamentarians and made a patchwork with them? I looked for a while how to analyse them for gender, age and skin color. One obvious candidate was Rekognition from AWS if only because the instances at my workplace decided to use AWS services. Getting a little bit more familiar with using these seemed therefore like a good choice.
I searched for R packages to use Rekognition with, but did not find any.</description>

      <description>In the last post we were pretty successful in getting our parliamentarians Twitter handles. We can now use these to download their tweets.
The twitter API allows to download 3200 tweets per handle. This means that we will not be able to download all tweets of all parliamentarians from the last five years, because some of them tweeted more than 3200 during that time period. But there will be a fair amount.</description>

      <description>Now that we can scrape the names of the parliamentarians of the 54th legislature, we can try to find their Twitter accounts too.
Let’s start by reconstructing the list. Then we can search Twitter for their accounts handles. A bit of grunt work and no visuals in this post, but it is needed to harvest parlaimentarians’ tweets soonish.
Starting with attaching libraries, and in particular ‘rtweet’.

      <description>For a country as small as Belgium 6 governments is a lot. It’s maybe because we Belgians like to be governed and governed well. Why else would we want to pay for 6 governments, their administration and their parliaments?
We also love politicians, so we want to have many. I also like politicians and decided to do some NLP on their tweets. But since there are a significant number of politicians in Belgium I searched for an objective criteria to define a subset.</description>
