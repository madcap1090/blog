      <description>In the last post there was a fairly extensive analysis presented on what is possible to obtain from Facebook on political ads in Belgium. There was a fair amount of data to play with even if it took some energy and time to clean it and filter the ‘issues’ ads from the political ads.
However Facebook does not present and makes available enough data to analyse what type of deep manipulation is possible using their services.</description>

      <description>I was looking for a way to have the same level of analysis of Facebook that is possible with the Twitter API, but gave up after a short while. The API seems to me quite closed in terms of what information is made available by Facebook.
So I was quiet interested when I come across this blog post of Mr Schmidt not on an API for Facebook generally, but for Facebook ads.</description>
