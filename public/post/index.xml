      <description>For a country as small as Belgium 6 governments is a lot. Its maybe because we Belgians like to be governed and governed well. Why else would we pay for all of them, their administration and their parliaments?
We also love politicians, so we want to have a lot of them. I also like politicians so I decided to do some NLP on their tweets. But since there are a significant number of them I searched for an objective criteria to subset them.</description>

      <description>I got a bit distracted writing the last post. What I want to find out is, based on my Google location history, how fast I bike to work and if this has changed over time.
Attaching libraries
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;lubridate&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;glue&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;purrr&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggmap&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;); theme_set(theme_minimal())And loading the data
# the code to convert your location data to a data frame:# see last post too# data &amp;lt;- fromJSON(&amp;quot;./data/Location History.</description>

      <description>Biking to work this week I was wondering if I had not gotten slower and if my commute was not taking longer than before. Not being a regular user of Strava or a similar app, I wondered if I could find an answer to that question using my Google location history.
So I downloaded the data, that comes in json format, and had a go at it. You can download your Google location data from your Google account.</description>
